When you’ve got a lot of free time — like in my case, where I just finished my internship, don’t have a job yet, and still have to wait about 3 months to officially graduate as a Systems Engineer — you need to find something to do. Besides sending my resume to every job post that matched my profile (and getting zero replies), I figured I’d put together a portfolio with my projects, skills, and experience to see if that helps improve my chances of getting hired… and well, here we are.

The first thing I thought was: how can I make this as fast as possible, but still make it look solid? I wanted something that had all the important stuff, but also felt like “me.” That’s when I remembered **Astro**. I had never used it before, to be honest. I do have experience with frontend — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the almighty Angular — but frontend isn’t really my thing. So, I started looking for a ready-made Astro template that could fit what I was going for.

Luckily, I found this one you’re seeing now — it was public and ready to use. I downloaded it right away and started customizing it to my style, adding all my info. Just to be clear: **I HAD NEVER TOUCHED ASTRO IN MY LIFE**. I’ve always focused more on backend and data analysis, since design isn’t exactly my strength. And yeah, it took me like 8 hours to get most of the info in and deploy it to Vercel — and yes, it was a bit of a journey figuring out which file did what and where to change stuff — but hey, I pulled it off.

At this point, I’ve got a pretty good handle on how to manage the content. The site still has the touch of the original creator: **Fernando López** ([https://github.com/EFEELE](https://github.com/EFEELE)), who I genuinely thank from here for doing such an awesome job — seriously, without that base, I wouldn’t have been able to make this.

So yeah, if there’s something I took away from this experience, it’s that **you don’t always have to start from scratch**. That’s what the dev community is here for — to share, help, and save you time when you need it. In cases like mine, where all you want is to move forward, have something that works, and show what you can do, **it’s totally okay to skip the “build it all yourself” part**.

At the end of the day, what matters is having something that represents you and helps you take the next step. So if you’re in a similar spot — don’t feel bad about using templates or building on someone else’s work. What counts is what *you* do with it.
