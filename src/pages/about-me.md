My journey into the world of technology began in an unexpected way, right in the middle of the **2020** pandemic, when I started my degree in **Systems and Computer Engineering** at the prestigious **Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar**. Starting university remotely was a challenge, but also an opportunity to dive headfirst into the vast digital universe opening up before me.

During the first few semesters, my curiosity led me to explore many branches of engineering: from traditional software development to the complexities of networking. Each class was another piece in a puzzle that was slowly taking shape.

This growing passion for data analysis directly shaped my final degree project, where I decided to tackle a pressing modern challenge: the spread of misinformation. This led to the creation of **TrueShield**, a fake news detection system currently in development. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing techniques, **TrueShield** aims to analyze content and identify the subtle patterns of disinformation. This project is more than just an academic requirement; it's a personal mission to apply technology towards creating a more informed and truthful digital space.

This academic journey quickly paved the way for my first significant professional experience: an internship at **Tenaris TuboCaribe**. There, I had the chance to put my skills into practice by joining the Business Partner team. My main focus was on automating key processes within the Human Resources department. I'll admit, as a Systems Engineer, I never imagined my path would lead me to HR, but it turned out to be an incredibly enlightening experience. It taught me how technology can drive efficiency and create value in every corner of a company, even the most human-centric ones.

## The Discovery of Data Analysis 📊

While I explored various fields, it was around the seventh semester that something just *clicked*. I discovered **data analysis**, and I was captivated by the ability to transform numbers and statistics into stories, decisions, and tangible solutions. I understood that data is the heart of modern operations and that knowing how to interpret it is one of the most powerful skills in today's world. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to focus my career in that direction.

## My Current Focus: AI & Automation 🤖

My curiosity is insatiable. I am constantly learning, researching, and developing personal projects to test new technologies. Currently, my main interest lies in the **integration of AI models and agents with data analysis**.

My goal is clear: to automate complex processes, a vision that was solidified during my professional internships. There, I saw firsthand the immense potential these tools have to transform operations at a corporate level, optimizing efficiency and generating real value.

## Beyond the Code 🏃‍♂️🎧

But my life isn't confined to screens and algorithms. Discipline and perseverance are values I've also cultivated outside of academia. Since I was young, I've practiced **athletics**, a passion that has led me to compete at a **national level in Colombia**. This sport has taught me about effort, consistency, and the importance of pushing my own limits—lessons I apply every day in my professional career.

The other constant in my life is music. If you see me, it's almost certain I'll have my **headphones on**. Music is my companion for focusing, relaxing, and finding the perfect rhythm for every line of code I write.
